# Welcome to my dotfiles!
These are my personal dotfiles for applications that I use often.  
Note: My configs are not very advanced, so those looking for a work of art may be looking in the wrong place.  

<br/>

# Inspiration
Lots of my dotfiles have taken heavy inspiration from [Derek Taylor's Dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles).
